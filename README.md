# Remodel-Database
Design and execution of database containing home remodel information
This repository reflects supplies and other project planning entities and attributes for my personal home remodel projects. There will be a number of projects included ranging from basic flooring installations, landscaping, painting, and plumbing. 
Spending my free time building, repairing, and replacing different rooms/aspects of my home has created a need to organize the tools and materials I own as well as the multiple aspects my home renovation projects to serve as a guide for future endeavors.
